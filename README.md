We want to be able use a single mechanism to generate Events to execute Commands in a distributed infrastructure.

Browser (Event) -> Server (EventBus) -> Queue:Router -> CommandBus -> Command

Event:
```
{
    type: 'EventType',
    id: 'j57lpaiw-1xk1n62cde7',
    transport: 'amqp',
    transport: {
        req:'amqp',
        res:'ws'
    },
    payload: {}
}
```
